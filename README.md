Homework 1 : Code Refactor assignment

Webpage without semantics.

I applyed different sementics tags on html elements:

-header tag to separate the header with the main body of the page,
-nav tag for the navigation links,
-section tag for the main picture of the page,
-main tag for the "container" block,
-section tag for each block of the "container",
-aside tag for the "benefit" block,
-section for each block of "benefit", 
-footer tag for the footer.

I added id to create a link between the nav elements and the "container" ones.

I set header position to fixed.

I added alt attributes to all img elements.

I changed the div element in the CSS file the make them correspond to their change on the html and also edited the padding and bottom margin px of each section block of "container" to make them have the same height with the aside box.
