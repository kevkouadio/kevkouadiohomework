Homework 1 : Code Refactor assignment

Webpage without semantics.

I applyed different sementics tags on html elements:

-header tag to separate the header with the main body of the page,
-nav tag for the navigation links,
-section tag for the main picture of the page,
-main tag for the "container" block,
-section tag for each block of the "container",
-Aside tag for the "benefit" block,
-section for each block of "benefit", 
-footer tag for the footer.

I added id to create a link between the nav elements and the "container" ones.

I set position on fixed.

I changed the div element in the CSS file the make them correspond to their change on the html.
